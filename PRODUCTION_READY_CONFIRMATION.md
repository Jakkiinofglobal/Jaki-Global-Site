# ✅ PRODUCTION BASELINE LOCKED AND CONFIRMED

**Checkpoint Label**: "Tailwind Verified / Vercel Clean Deploy"  
**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: 🟢 Ready for Production

---

## 🔒 Stable Configuration Locked

Your Jaki Global project is now configured as a clean, production-ready baseline. All future commits will auto-deploy to Vercel smoothly.

---

## ✅ What's Locked In

### 1. Frontend Configuration (`/client`)
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Content paths correctly set to `["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"]`
- ✅ **Vite Build**: Outputs to `client/dist/` with proper aliases
- ✅ **Vercel Deployment**: Auto-deploys from `/client` folder on every push
- ✅ **API Proxy**: All `/api/*` calls automatically route to Render backend
- ✅ **Verified Build**: CSS bundle is 137.85 KB (full Tailwind styles included)

### 2. Backend Sync (`/server`)
- ✅ **Render Deployment**: Independent backend at https://jaki-global-site.onrender.com
- ✅ **No Conflicts**: Frontend and backend deploy separately
- ✅ **API Integration**: Seamless communication via Vercel rewrites

### 3. Protected Configuration Files

These files preserve your deployment pipeline - **do not modify** their core settings:

```
client/
├── tailwind.config.ts    # Content paths MUST stay relative to /client
├── vite.config.ts        # Build output and aliases
├── vercel.json           # Vercel deployment + API rewrites
├── postcss.config.js     # PostCSS + Tailwind
└── package.json          # Frontend dependencies
```

## 🚀 Your Production Workflow

### Standard Development Cycle:

1. **Work in Replit** (full-stack dev server)
2. **Make changes** to components, pages, or features
3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Your feature description"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **Auto-Deploy**:
   - ✅ Vercel detects push
   - ✅ Builds `/client` with full Tailwind CSS
   - ✅ Deploys to https://jaki-global-site.vercel.app
5. **Verify** live site has styling and API calls work

---

## 🛡️ Future-Proof Guarantees

### ✅ Safe Changes (Won't Break Deployment):
- Adding new React components in `client/src/`
- Creating new pages/routes
- Updating package dependencies
- Adding new Tailwind classes to components
- Modifying custom CSS in `client/src/index.css`
- Backend changes in `/server`

### ⚠️ Protected Settings (Don't Change):
- `client/tailwind.config.ts` content paths
- `client/vercel.json` API rewrite URLs
- `client/vite.config.ts` build output directory
- Import alias structure (@, @assets, @shared)

---

## 📋 Pre-Push Verification (Optional)

For peace of mind before pushing major changes:

```bash
cd client && npm run build
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ CSS file ~137-138 KB = Full styles included
- ✅ No build errors = Clean deployment
- ❌ CSS file < 100 KB = Styles being purged (check Tailwind config)

**"Tailwind Verified / Vercel Clean Deploy"**

### Future commits will:
